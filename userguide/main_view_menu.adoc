== The Main View Menu

The main view menu presents the following options:

* <<select_tiles, Select tile source>>: allows the selection of a map tile source to be used as a basemap
* <<create_new_project,Create new project>>: creates a new project on the sdcard. A timestamp based name is proposed to the user
* <<load_project,Load existing project>>: allows the browsing of the filesystem to select an existing geopaparazzi project file to load it
* <<gps_status,GPS Status>>: opens a GPS status application to check on satellite visibility
* Advanced: shows some advanced user options such as the application log or custom database queries
* About: shows the about page, which contains info, links and acknowledgements
* <<exit,Exit>>: shuts down geopaparazzi properly. This is important, because geopaparazzi is meant to continue logging also in background. Therefore, if one uses the android home button to exit the app, it will continue to work in background, most probably draining the battery through GPS use.

=== Select tile source
anchor:select_tiles[]

From the main menu, when pushing the tile source button, the list of available tile sources are presented, organized by folder:

.The basemaps view.

Each map source has a name and a type description between brackets.

At the current time four types are supported:

* Mapsforge Map
* Mapurl
* MBTiles
* RasterLite2

The <<supported_datasets, supported datasets>> section lists and describes all supported 
map types.

Through the button at the top of the view the user can filter the source 
types to show.

.The map type filter dialog, set to only show MBTiles sources.

which makes searching simpler when a lot of sources are present on the device.

Basemaps can be added to the list from the device storage through the two buttons at the bottom of the view. The right one allows to pick a single file to add it as a basemap, while the left one allows to bulk load a complete folder of maps.  Once the basemap has been added to the list, tap the basemap on the list to use in the Map View.


=== Create a new project
anchor:create_new_project[]

When a new project is created, the user is prompted to give a file name
for the new project file. This is the name that will be given to the 
database file that contains all data surveyed in Geopaparazzi.

.The new project input dialog.

Once the name is defined, an new empty database is created and Geopaparazzi is 
restarted and opened loading the new created project.

=== Load an existing project
anchor:load_project[]

Existing projects can be loaded using a simple file browser from within Geoapaparazzi. The Geopaparazzi project files are shown with an icon to help the user to choose the proper files.

=== GPS Status
anchor:gps_status[]

The GPS status entry launches the open source application https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.gpstest[GPS test]. The app shows the current status of the satellites fix and a skymap. This often helps to understand why the GPS is not working.

=== Exit
anchor:exit[]

The exit button closes Geopaparazzi and stops any ongoing logging and 
sensor activity.

This might seem obvious, but it is important to note that this is the *only way to properly close Geopaparazzi*. Pushing the home button of the device will not close Geopaparazzi, which will continue any activity started. This is important, because it makes very long loggings possible even if interrupted by phone calls or other uses of the device.

Often users that ignore this, after pushing the home screen and thinking that Geopaparazzi has been closed, experience a faster battery drop, because of the active application in the background.
