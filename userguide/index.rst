What is Geopaparazzi?
-------------------------

Geopaparazzi is a tool developed to do **very fast qualitative** engineering/geologic surveys. 
Even if the main aim is in the field of surveying, it contains tools that can be 
of great use also to `OpenStreetMappers`_ as well as tourists that want to keep a geo-diary.
