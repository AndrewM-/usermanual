== Because not all paparazzis are evil!

Geopaparazzi is a tool developed to do **very fast qualitative** engineering/geologic surveys. 

Even if the main aim is in the field of surveying, it contains tools that can be 
of great use also to http://www.osm.org[OpenStreetMappers] as well as tourists that
want to keep a geo-diary.
